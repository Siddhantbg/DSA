You can say that when you don't need to create objects of a class, you can use static for methods or variables that should belong to the class itself, rather than to individual objects (instances) of that class. Here are a few key points to consider:

When to Use static:
Class-Level Behavior: Use static when the behavior or data doesn't rely on instance-specific information. If the method or variable is something that is the same for all instances of the class (or doesn't need instances at all), it makes sense to declare it as static.

Example: Utility methods (like Math.pow(), Math.sqrt()) or constants (Math.PI).
No Need for Object Creation: If you don't need to create an object to use the method, use static.

Example: Your BFS method doesn't rely on any instance-specific state, so making it static allows you to call it directly from main() without needing to instantiate the class.
When You Need static:
Access from a static context: In particular, the main method is static because it must run before any objects are created. If you want to call another method from main and that method does not depend on instance variables, it needs to be static.

public static void main(String[] args) {
    BFS(startVertex, A, n);  // BFS must be static because main is static
}
When Not to Use static:
Instance-Specific Data: If the method or variable depends on an individual object's state (i.e., instance variables), do not use static. For example, if BFS required access to an object-specific adjacency matrix stored in an instance variable, static wouldn't work because each instance could have a different matrix.
Example:

class MyClass {
    static int staticVar = 10; // Shared across all objects
    int instanceVar = 20;      // Each object has its own copy

    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method.");
        // Cannot access instanceVar here
    }

    void instanceMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is an instance method.");
        System.out.println("Instance variable: " + instanceVar); // Can access instance variables here
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass.staticMethod();  // Call static method without creating an object
        
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.instanceMethod();    // Need an object to call instance methods
    }
}
Summary:
Use static when you want to define a method or variable at the class level, not tied to any specific object.
You can call static methods or access static variables without creating an instance of the class.
