vector<vector<int>> ans(n, vector<int>(n, 1));

is a way to create and initialize a 2D vector in C++ (essentially a matrix). Let's break down what it does:

Key Parts:
vector<vector<int>> ans:

This declares ans as a 2D vector (a vector of vectors) of type int.
It will be used to store a matrix with n rows and n columns, where each element is an integer.
vector<int>(n, 1):

This creates a 1D vector of size n where each element is initialized to 1.
This represents one row of the 2D vector (or matrix).
vector<vector<int>> ans(n, ...):

This creates a 2D vector with n rows.
Each row is initialized using the expression vector<int>(n, 1), meaning each row will be a 1D vector of size n, with all elements initialized to 1.


Full Explanation:
vector<vector<int>> ans(n, vector<int>(n, 1)) creates an n x n matrix where all elements are initialized to 1.
The outer vector has n rows.
Each row (which is a vector<int>) has n elements, and all elements are set to 1.
Example:
For n = 3, the matrix (ans) created would look like this:

[
  [1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1]
]
This is a 3x3 matrix where all values are initialized to 1. You can access or modify elements in this 2D vector like a typical matrix, for example, ans[0][1] will give you the element in the first row and second column.
